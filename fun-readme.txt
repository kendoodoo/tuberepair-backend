  things to note
------------------

Number one: DO NOT CHECK THE CODE FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR EYES

Number two: DO NOT SHARE THIS ON LEGACYJAILBREAK, THIS IS A BETA (risk of legacychildren asking for some url)

Number three: EDIT config.py FILE TO YOUR LIKINGS

Number four: IF YOU ENCOUNTER ISSUES, SEND AN ISSUE IN GITHUB.

     for devs
------------------
 config.py: config, pretty flexible (not boasting)
 main.py: flask handler
 get.py: fetch api from invidious, return output for main.py
 log.py: log

 PLEASE. IF YOU CAN HELP. DO IT. THANKS.
